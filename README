X-Search.pl Version 1.04.


I<X-Search> reads a series of search commands from a plain text
configuration file and then retrieves the results from the specified
search engine and stores them in individule dated files
F<qid/YYYYMMDD.html> which is a detailed web page record of the search
results for the days date. Summaries of each search (if you have print
summaries turned on) as well as a link history to each
F<qid/YYYYMMDD.html> file are maintained in one F<index.html> file.

Any new search results for a 24 hour perioud are written to both the 
F<qid/YYYYMMDD.html> and F<index.html> files. If F<qid/YYYYMMDD.html> 
already exists with previous search results for the date then it will be
appended with newer results in a chronological order. If there is nothing new
then nothing is written. 

I<X-Search> stores the url's from search results to a data file enabling 
it to track what it already has seen. This insures subsequent searches are
unique and allows one to copy additional undesirable urls in blocks to this
file to prevent X-Search from recording them if they are ever encountered 
in a future search. 

I<X-Search> is ideal for maintaining records of frequent news events and
can safely be run as many times as desired daily to determine new news
events to index that matches the users search requirements. For
instance: You could track any number of newsgroups three times daily for
new posts by passing the search option "groups=". So, in the option
field in the configuration file you could insert |groups=alt.some.group|
or, if you wanted to search all groups related to perl you could do
this: |groups=*perl*|

I<X-Search> is ideal for web sites to present to their users detailed dated
summaries of specific topics around the web that can change frequently. Thus,
users are presented with the most current new additions as found in a pretty
informative chronological order.

I<X-Search> Allows the option of verifying the url address to determine if
it is valid or not. Any url's that are found not valid, i.e., moved, not
found, are ignored.

I<X-Search> allows one with a lot of flexibility to use in all sorts of
neat applications.
