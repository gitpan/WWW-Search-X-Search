Changes for X-Search.pl Version 1.04.


Version 1.04

 - Added remote administration so one can run X-Search or edit the
   configuration file through their web browser. This allows one
   to run X-Search as a CGI script on their server.

Version 1.03

 - Created a hack to track Dejanews articles properly
 - added escaping and unescaping ?'s in urls because 
   they would raise havoc with my regex leading to urls
   being printed over and over
